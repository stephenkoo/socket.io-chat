# Socket.io chat system
I built this basic Socket.io chat app to teach myself how to use websockets to add realtime functionality to a website.

## Installation
```
git clone https://github.com/stephenkoo/socket.io-chat.git
npm install
node app.js
```

## Usage
Open multiple pages with the address localhost:3000.
Create different users and chat with yourself in realtime!
